# 03 — Usage & runbook

How to run and drive the dsh-based OpenSwarm. Architecture is [docs/01](01-dsh-foundation.md); this is the operator's guide.

## Setup

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

`npm run build` compiles the plugin packages to `dist/` (esbuild; bare imports external). The launcher refuses to run until this is done.

## The launcher

`bin/openswarm` wraps `dsh --profile openswarm[-dev]`: it initializes profiles on first use, auto-detects the provider, and maps flags to the `OPENSWARM_*` env the bundle reads.

```
openswarm "<task>"          run one task headless
openswarm run "<task>"      same
openswarm serve [--port N]  start the app-server (default :4620)
openswarm setup             (re)initialize profiles
openswarm config            print resolved provider / model / home
```

Options: `--model <id>`, `--provider <azure|openai|bedrock>`, `--home <dir>`, `--port <n>`.

Profile home defaults to `$OPENSWARM_HOME` or `~/.openswarm`. Profiles are re-initialized by `setup` (or delete the home and re-run).

## Providers

Auto-detected in order — Azure, then OpenAI, then Bedrock — from these env vars:

| Provider | Env | Default model |
|---|---|---|
| `azure` | `AZURE_API_BASE` + `AZURE_API_KEY` | `gpt-5.5` |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` (opt. `OPENSWARM_LLM_BASE_URL` for LiteLLM/compatible) | `gpt-5.5` |
| `bedrock` | `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` (+ `AWS_REGION`) | `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-…` |

Force a choice with `--provider` / `--model` or `OPENSWARM_PROVIDER` / `OPENSWARM_MODEL`.

## Profiles

The launcher's `init-profile.mjs` writes two profiles into the home and heals a `node_modules` so the bundle's plugins resolve by bare name:

- **`openswarm`** — HMR cold, includes `dsh-headless` (one-shot task runner → drives a task, then exits). The default for `openswarm run` and for eval.
- **`openswarm-dev`** — HMR hot, app-server bound, and **no** headless runner (the app-server's socket keeps the process alive to serve). Used by `openswarm serve`.

Inspect the composed tree at any time:

```bash
DSH_HOME=~/.openswarm dsh --profile openswarm --dump-config      # or openswarm-dev
```

You'll see `llm-deepseek` disabled, the OpenSwarm rows inserted under a `# == openswarm-bundle` provenance header, all over `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`.

## The app-server (for UIs/TUIs)

`openswarm serve` binds a newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint (dsh's SDK session protocol + swarm methods). Connect with `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sdk-protocol`'s `JsonRpcLineTransport`:

- Delegated (dsh): `initialize`, `session/prompt`, streamed `session.event` / `session.status`.
- Swarm extension:
  - `swarm/runTeam { spec, provider, model, worktrees? } → { runId }`; completion arrives as a `swarm.runFinished` notification carrying the `TeamResult`.
  - `swarm/runs {} → { runs: [{ runId, status, leadSessionId }] }`.
  - `swarm/board { runId } → { tasks }`.

A `spec` is a `TeamSpec` — e.g. `{ topology: 'fanout', members: [{name}], tasks: [{member, prompt}] }`. See the topology types in [`packages/swarm/src/types.ts`](../packages/swarm/src/types.ts). A worked client is [`packages/app-server/tests/app-server.e2e.test.ts`](../packages/app-server/tests/app-server.e2e.test.ts).

## Driving a team in-process

`ctx.swarm.runTeam(spec, { parent, worktrees? })` is the programmatic entry point. `RunTeamOptions.worktrees` turns member runs into subprocess harnesses in per-task git worktrees and returns a merge outcome. Members set `agentOptions: { provider, model }` for heterogeneous rosters. See [`packages/swarm/tests/boot.ts`](../packages/swarm/tests/boot.ts) for a minimal composition.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                          # full keyless suite (scripted mock LLM)
npm run typecheck                 # tsc across all packages
OPENSWARM_LIVE=1 npm test         # + env-gated live tests (needs AZURE_/AWS creds)
```

Live tests skip themselves without `OPENSWARM_LIVE=1` and the relevant creds. The reusable message-boarding harness ([`board-harness.ts`](../packages/swarm/tests/support/board-harness.ts)) runs the same durable-mailbox scenarios in mock and live mode from one place.

## Eval

The discrimination-set rerun and SWE-bench harness live under `legacy/eval/` and drive the sandbox-deployable CLI bundle (`npm run bundle:cli` → `packages/cli/dist/openswarm.mjs`). Results and mechanics: [docs/02](02-discrimination-rerun.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **"packages are not built"** → `npm run build`.
- **"no model provider configured"** → set one provider's env vars, or pass `--provider`/`--model`.
- **The `dsh` bin is missing** → `npm install` (pulls `@deepseek-ai/dsh`).
- **A team member can't reach the model** → confirm `openswarm config` shows the intended provider/model; the member harness inherits `OPENSWARM_LLM_*` from the launcher.
- **Reset everything** → delete the profile home (`~/.openswarm`) and re-run; profiles re-initialize.
