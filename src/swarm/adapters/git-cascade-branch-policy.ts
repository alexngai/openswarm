 * git-cascade dep.
 *
 * Per docs/29 §V0.7.Q7, the adapter pattern mirrors v0.5's taskWrapper
 * (5B opentasks) and v0.6's inboxBackend (6A.2 agent-inbox): an external
 * library wraps part of StandaloneHost's behavior via an injectable
 * interface, with an identity default that preserves existing semantics
 * for callers that don't opt in.
